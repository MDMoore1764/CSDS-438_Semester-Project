# CSDS-438_Semester-Project
The semester-long project repository for CSDS 438

## Project Description (from Canvas, adding here for easy access) 
You will be implementing the concepts and computational tools you have learned throughout the course in real time applications. This is an opportunity to form your own group, explore, research, implement, and present on a particular area of interest in a given pool of projects.

Write a research paper on one of the topics of your interest where you will be employing one of the Parallel programming Model/languages covered in the class including HADOOP, singularity container. Possible Topics include:

Text Mining of great works (e.g. bestseller novels, great hits) to identify their secret
Performance Comparison of Sorting Algorithms using various programming models (eg. OpenMP, OpenACC, etc).
Predicting the outcome (e.g. stock price) through social media popularity
Natural Language Processing, Image Processing or voice cloning using GPUs
Predicting social media addiction
Effect of climate change on mountain ranges

## Presentation
The presentation portion of the Research Project is worth 25 points. You are expected to:

Create a slide deck to present during the zoom session
Your group will be allocated a certain time slot (depends on members in a group) to present it via zoom
Every member of a group needs to present their part of the presentation through recordings introducing themselves first for grading purposes
Grades are based on how well the message is conveyed (see Rubrics for details)
